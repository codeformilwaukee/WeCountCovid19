## What is the WeCountCOVID19.com survey?

The [WeCountCOVID19.com](https://milwaukee.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3F7CQTkIgR3zugl) is a short, **confidential** survey that is intended for anyone who even thinks they might be ill from the coronavirus. The goal is to identify what and where the COVID19 symptoms are. 

- **If you are sick**, find help, and then please take the 5 minute survey on [WeCountCOVID19.com](https://milwaukee.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3F7CQTkIgR3zugl)
   - You can take this survey on a computer or a smartphone. 
   - You can also have someone take this survey with you if you need assistance.
   - This is a confidential survey.
- **If you are not sick**, please pass this survey along to 3 friends.

### Why take the survey?

This survey was created by a Epidemiology professor to help determine coronavirus risk by geographical location. We will soon link to public data analysis from the survey to help local communities identify the risks they face. Your survey survey response can help your local community to make data-driven policy decisions to protect citizens. 

Please help to share this survey with anyone who may be ill - we hope that their survey response will help to keep people safe and healthy.

> Hi friends, in order to “flatten the curve”, we need to know more about what and where COVID-19 symptoms are. Testing is limited, so an online survey has been developed (in Milwaukee!).
>
> The idea is simple:  If you or a loved one are sick, whether or not you have had any test for COVID-19, please use a phone or computer and go to WeCountCOVID19.com and report symptoms confidentially.
