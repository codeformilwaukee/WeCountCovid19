# WeCountCovid19

## What is the WeCountCOVID19.com survey?

The [WeCountCOVID19.com](www.WeCountCOVID19.com) is a short, **confidential** survey that is intended for anyone who even thinks they might be ill from the coronavirus. The goal is to identify what and where the COVID19 symptoms are. Every voice counts. We all count.

[WeCountCOVID19.com](www.WeCountCOVID19.com) is now reporting data analyses from the results of the survey. By reaching all citizens who are possibly sick, regardless of positive, negative, or no coronvirus test at all, we hope to build rich, localized (down to the zip code!) reports of the symptoms and risks of coronavirus in Wisconsin.

## Please share the survey!

Here is some sample language you can copy and paste into your email, any messaging app, or social media to share the word. Please help us to reach as many sick people as possible!
